# Building a To-Do List Application in Go with HTMX, SQL, and Tailwind CSS

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to create a dynamic To-Do List application using Go for backend development, HTMX for dynamic front-end interactions, SQL for database management, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Steps

### 1. Setup Project Environment
- [x] Install Go, set up the Go workspace.
- [x] Install and configure a SQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
- [x] Set up HTMX and Tailwind CSS in the project.

### 2. Create SQL Database Schema
- [ ] Define and create a SQL table for storing to-do items.
  - Include fields such as `id`, `task`, `status`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.

### 3. Create a To-Do Object in Go
- [x] Define a Go struct that mirrors the SQL table structure for to-do items.

### 4. Develop Backend Functionality in Go
- [x] **Initialize a Web Server:** Set up a Go server with necessary routes.
- [x] **Create Base To-Do Page Route:** Develop a route to serve the base HTML page, including existing to-do items.
- [x] **List To-Dos Route:** Implement a route to retrieve and display a list of current to-dos from the database.
- [x] **Add To-Do Route:** Develop a route for adding new to-do items to the database.
- [x] **Update To-Do Route:** Create a route to handle updating the status or content of an existing to-do item.
- [x] **Delete To-Do Route:** Establish a route to delete a specific to-do item from the database.

### 5. Integrate HTMX for Dynamic Content
- [x] Use HTMX to enhance front-end interactions without full page reloads.
  - Implement HTMX requests in the front-end for adding, updating, and deleting to-do items.
  - Ensure HTMX dynamically updates the to-do list on the page in response to user actions.

### 6. Add Tailwind CSS for Styling
- [x] Utilize Tailwind CSS to style the to-do list page.
  - Apply styles to the to-do items, buttons, and form elements.
  - Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes.

### 7. Testing
- [x] Perform thorough testing of each functionality.
  - Test the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on to-do items.
  - Ensure HTMX updates the page correctly without a full reload.
  - Validate the layout and responsiveness with Tailwind CSS.

### 8. Deployment
- [ ] Prepare the application for deployment.
- [ ] Choose a hosting service and deploy the application.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will develop a fully functional, dynamically interactive, and well-styled To-Do List application using Go, HTMX, SQL, and Tailwind CSS.
